Introduction
============
pg_logforward is a custom logging handler for PostgreSQL. It intercepts
all PostgreSQL log messages by hooking into EmitErrorReport() function
in the backend. The intercepted log messages are forwarded via UDP to
a remote location.

Requires PostgreSQL logging hooks patch - included in the patches directory.
The patch is against 9.2devel but also applies against 9.1 and 8.3. Although
some offsets are expected.

Output formats
==============
The current version only supports JSON output and requires json-c library to
be present in the system. There are plans to replace the JSON with tnetstrings
as they are much cheaper to generate and parse. See: http://tnetstrings.org/

Usage
=====
Modify postgresql.conf to include:

shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_logforward'	# requires restart
custom_variable_classes = 'pg_logforward'	# deprecated in 9.2
pg_logforward.remote_host = 127.0.0.1		# no host names at this time
pg_logforward.remote_port = 23456

Note that you need to copy the shared library also to $libdir/plugins if you
are planning to use local_preload_libraries instead of shared_preload_libraries.
